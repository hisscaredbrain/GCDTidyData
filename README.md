# Course Project in Getting and Cleaning Data
Author: Harsha UB

This project uses the data from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). If one desires, dataset and dataset description can be downloaded from the above links as well. However, we shall use the dataset that been mirrored in a course specific [location](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## Objective or Goal of this project as described in the course material
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ones ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This translates into following artefacts that need to be present in the repository - 

1) A tidy data set as described in the project(see below)
2) A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4) A README.md in the repo with your scripts. This [file]() explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
